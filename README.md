# StockPrediction
A simple yet powerful web application that predicts stock prices using machine learning, displays live-updating graphs, and provides a user-friendly interface built with Python and modern web technologies.

🚀 Features
📊 Real-time Stock Price Prediction

🤖 Machine Learning Model for forecasting

📈 Live-updating Graph (refreshes every 5 seconds)

🖥️ Clean UI using streamlit or tkinter (depending on version)

✅ Easy to use — just enter a stock symbol and watch predictions in real-time!

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Linear Regression / LSTM)

Matplotlib / Plotly – Data visualization

Streamlit / Tkinter – Web/App Interface

yfinance  – Live stock data (optional)

🧠 How It Works
Fetches recent stock data using APIs

Prepares features like moving average, volume, etc.

Trains a regression model to predict the next price

Displays both historical and predicted data on a live graph
